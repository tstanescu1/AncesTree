# AncesTree
AncesTree is a Pokédex-style React Native app that helps users identify plants, fungi, and trees — with a focus on their ancestral medicinal properties. It combines AI-powered plant recognition with a growing community knowledge base, allowing people to reconnect with nature, healing, and wisdom.
